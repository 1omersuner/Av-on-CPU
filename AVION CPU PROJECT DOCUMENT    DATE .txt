Abstract — Designing a processor with using verilog language.
Keywords — FPGA, CPU.
Abstract — Verilog dilini kullanarak işlemci tasarımı.
Keywords — FPGA, CPU.
I.	INTRODUCTION
Within the scope of this project, the RTL design of a processor called Avion-CPU has written in verliog language and various code snippets written in machine language has written on the designed processor

II.	SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
Von Neumann Architecture used in processor.
 

THİS CPU HAS 4 MAİN UNİTS:
Register, memory(RAM), processing unit(ALU), control unit.

The processor supports 9 instructions:

 
[3:0] Operation code, [5:0] Address or Number	



III.	SOFTWARE USED
We use a simulation system while we are making the CPU design in our website.

IV.	RESULTS
The processor has been successfully coded.
